It's been just a week since I announced Mail v1.6.1 here on this blog and yet there is a new release â€“ v1.7.0.

In this minor update we have three new features: 

* You can now move mailboxes around. Like from the root to a submailbox, from one mailbox to another or from a submailbox to the root.
* Improved HTML rendering makes the iframe that contains the email HTML responsive in height, so it will expand to the full content. Moreover, we previously trimmed some specialized formatting and some emails looked a bit different when compared to other email clients. Most of these differences are fixed now.
* Existing messages can be edited as new one. Like if you just sent a message to Alice you can send the same message to Bob.

[Here's the full changelog](https://github.com/nextcloud/mail/releases/tag/v1.7.0).

Cheers :v:
