Similar to what the [Rust community is doing with #Rust2018 right
now](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Rust2018),
I'd like to write down my personal Nextcloud goals for 2018.

## Stabilize and extend Mail

Last year I primarily worked on the Mail app. While we've achieved a lot, there are still
some missing feature you would expect from a mail application. The app has become more
stable, IMO due to a stronger focus on writing automated tests, both for the back-end and the
front-end.

My goal is to continue this direction and make Mail a well-integrated, stable and
general-purpose email client for Nextcloud.

## More automation

In 2017, I started to develop [a little CLI helper](/2017/11/28/krankerl-nextcloud-app-mgmt.html)
to help me with managing, signing and publishing of Nextcloud apps. As it has shown
to be very helpful to me and a few others, I'll continue my effort on improving the
Nextcloud app maintenance experience.

That means I'll try to add automated GitHub release uploads that push the app archive as an
GitHub release asset and thus eliminates the only remaining manual step in the process of publishing
an app release with [Krankerl](/2017/11/28/krankerl-nextcloud-app-mgmt.html).

Furthermore, I'd like to add a few checks that verify that the app is valid, like running a XML
schema validation check for the `info.xml` file.

## Help others write high-quality apps

Developing and maintaining several apps has taught me a lot about the ups and downs of Nextcloud
app development. To help other people in our community, I'd like to share my experience.

### Guides

Writing a Nextcloud app is fairly straight forward if you know some PHP and have a basic
understanding of how PHP apps work. From my personal experience in writing my first apps,
I do remember that I sometimes struggled with the software design and architecture and
something like *best practices* were'nt provided anywhere.

To help others (especially newbies in the Nextcloud world), I'd like to publish a few
guides on Nextcloud development related topics like

* App architecture and design
* Testability and test strategies
  + [A testing tramework](/2018/02/27/testing-nextcloud-app.html)
* Improve code quality with the help of php7
* Continuous integration best practices
  + [`info.xml` validation](/2018/03/06/validate-nextcloud-info-xml.html)
* Development environment recommendations
* Front-end best practices

### Work towards a component library

Our design team is working very hard on unifying app layouts and the overall design.
However, apps still have to implement and adapt to design guidelines on their own.

To further unify the app ecosystem, I'd like to develop a component library for all
the components we've got covered by design guides. Although I'm not quite sure yet,
a library [based on Vue](https://github.com/christophwurst/nextcloud_vue)
could be a great start.

The main goal is to join forces on a common, well designed and tested component
library so that developers can write apps more quickly and with less redundancy.

## Task management

My last goal for 2018 is to keep my tasks at least as organized as they had been
in 2017. Switching to a Kanban-like model to schedule my work load for Nextcloud
tasks helped me develop a well-working pipeline to overlook issues and PRs
I'd been working on. Thus I'll continue to use [a GitHub project¹](https://github.com/orgs/nextcloud/projects/4)
for all my tasks. This also allows others (not only my coworkers but also anyone
in the community) to see what I'm focussing on right now and if/when a feature/bug
is being worked on.
